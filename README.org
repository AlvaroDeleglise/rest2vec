* Description
This repository contains the scripts used in [[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117538][rest2vec: Vectorizing the resting-state functional connectome using graph embedding]], by Zachery Morrissey, Liang Zhan, Olusola Ajilore, and Alex Leow (2020) in /NeuroImage/.
The python module =rest2vec.py= contains the =PhaseEmbedding= class used to create the graph embedding from functional connectome and brain region information data.
In addition, the =Neurosynth= class is used to provide convenience functions for plotting the Neurosynth meta-analysis data.
The associated Jupyter Notebook =rest2vec.ipynb= contains the code used to produce the results and graphics used in the paper.
For any questions or issues, please open an issue on the github repo or contact me via email at zmorri4@uic.edu.

* Dependencies
rest2vec was tested using an Ubuntu 16.04 machine using Python version 3.7.3 from the Anaconda distribution.
The library versions used are listed below and in =requirements.txt=.

- =bctpy= v0.5.0
- =matplotlib= v3.1.1
- =nibabel= v2.5.1
- =nilearn= v0.6.2
- =nipype= v1.3.0rc1
- =numpy= v1.17.3
- =scikit-learn= v0.21.3
- =scipy= v1.3.1
- =seaborn= v0.9.0
- =statsmodels= v0.10.1

* Usage

** =PhaseEmbedding= class
 The =rest2vec= module can be used to create an instance of the =PhaseEmbedding= class.
 The general usage is

 #+BEGIN_SRC python
   import rest2vec as r2v

   embedding = r2v.PhaseEmbedding(W, roi_xyz, roi_names, n_neighbors).fit()
 #+END_SRC

 where =W= is an /N/ \times{} /N/ \times{} /S/ array of resting-state functional connectomes for /N/ brain regions and /S/ subjects, =roi_xyz= is the /N/ \times{} 3 MNI coordinates for the brain regions, =roi_names= contains the names of each region, and =n_neighbors= is the number of neighbors used when computing the isomap embedding.
 (For larger datasets, e.g., the dataset from [[https://www.nitrc.org/projects/biocr_hcatlas/][Diez et al. 2015]] with 2514 regions, this process may take a few minutes to run.)

 The =PhaseEmbedding= object contains relevant attributes for convenient access, including

 - =embedding.nw=
   - /N/ \times{} /N/ \times{} /S/ connectomes
 - =embedding.avg_nw=
   - Average Pearson correlation connectome across subjects
 - =embedding.P=
   - Probability of negative correlation matrix
 - =embedding.theta=
   - Phase angle spatial embedding (PhASE) matrix
 - =embedding.K=, =embedding.Kcen=
   - Kernel similarity matrix and centered kernel similarity matrix
 - =embedding.evals=, =embedding.evecs=
   - Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of centered kernel matrix
 - =embedding.polar_embedding=
   - Polar coordinates of 2D isomap embedding
 - =embedding.D=
   - Distance to origin of 2D isomap embedding for each ROI
 - =embedding.df=
   - Pandas dataframe that contains the MNI (x,y,z)-coordinates, isomap embedding (x,y)- and (\theta, r)-coordinates, distance to origin, MMD community, and label name for each ROI
 - =embedding.qmax=
   - Eigenvector corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue of the centered kernel similarity matrix.
 - =embedding.mod=
   - Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) module assignment vector
 - =embedding.roi_xyz=
   - MNI coordinates for brain regions
 - =embedding.roi_names=
   - Names for brain regions

 While there are many brain plotting functions in Python from the [[https://nilearn.github.io/][Nilearn]] library, for users more comfortable with [[https://www.nitrc.org/projects/bnv/][BrainNet]], there is an =embedding.to_brainnet= method that exports the =PhaseEmbedding= object to =.node= and =.edge= files compatible with BrainNet.

** =Neurosynth= class

   The =Neurosynth= class offers some convenience functions for using [[https://www.neurosynth.org/][Neurosynth]] meta-analysis data with rest2vec. The general usage is

   #+begin_src python
     nsynth = r2v.Neurosynth(path, embedding)

     nsynth.plot_nsynth_vals()
     nsynth.plot_nsynth_brain()
   #+end_src

   where =path= is a string indicating the path to a Neurosynth =.nii.gz= file, and =embedding= is an instance of the =PhaseEmbedding= class.

   The two main plotting functions for the =Neurosynth= class are =plot_nsynth_vals= and =plot_nsynth_brain=. =plot_nsynth_vals= will plot the values from the Neurosynth =.nii.gz= file onto the isomap embedding provided by =embedding=, and =plot_nsynth_brain= will plot the values in the MNI template space at the ROI coordinates provided by =embedding=. The user can also pass a specific figure axes using the =ax= parameter for more control or for creating plot wrapper functions (see example in =rest2vec.ipynb=).
